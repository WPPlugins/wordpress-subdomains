Bug Fixes

* Post links were pointing to wrong subdomains in some cases due to a query that fetched the wrong id field

	If the post is linked to more than one subdomain have it's permalink point to that subdomain it's listed on.
	Should save being sent around the different subdomains which would prove odd if using different themes

Development Changes

* Gave all global variables a prefix of "csd_" to avoid any collisions with wordpress or other plugins

* Created classes for subdomain and a list of all subdomains. The subdomain class provides methods for checking if a post is part of that subdomain and taking a normal permalink and converting it to use the subdomain.

* When it is determined we are on a subdomain page/post it's subdomain object is referenced as $wps_this_subdomain giving you easy access to name, slug, children, cat_theme.

* Have init decide if we're in a subdomain page or category

* Do change theme based on $wps_this_subdomain. Much less code

* Split main plugin file into smaller, more managable files

Reduced code

Update v0.010 1/13/06
Added a checkbox on Category Editing pages to let you exclude categories from subdomaining.
  To make this work in Wordpress < 2.0, you have to add this line your wp-admin/categories.php file
  open wp-admin/categories.php
  around line 120, find this:
    header('Location: categories.php?message=3');
  add this code BEFORE the above header call:
    do_action('edit_category', $wpdb->insert_id);
    
  I don't know why it's not in there to begin with.  It seems like it should be.  There a call in all the other *_category actions.
  I hope I didn't mess it up.

  
Update v0.008
  Added a filter to wp_login that creates a cross domain cookie.  Booya!  I like the cool stuff.

Update v0.007 1/12/06

  That was stupid.
  Now I'm saving what to load in init and telling wordpress to do it with a query_string filter

Update v0.006
fixed it so ALL the links generated have subdomains:
  -posts
  -comments
  -authors
  -links in feeds

Update v0.005
Incoming categories are automatically rewritten 
    blog.com/category/cat_name -> cat_name.blog.com
If your category structure was different than just blog.com/category/cat_name, edit the $sr_cat_marker
    $sr_cat_marker = "archives/category/";
or whatever it is.

Old style posts are also rewritten
    blog.com/cat_name/post-title -> cat_name.blog.com/post-title

Wild card subdomains that don't match a category are automatically rewritten if $sr_redir_wildcards is TRUE!
    random.blog.com/whatever -> blog.com/whatever
